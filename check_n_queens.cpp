/*
   The idea of this function is to take a chessboard with "n"-queens placed
   on them in the form of a vector of size "n" . Index in  the vector
   represents the row and value at the index represents the column.
   suppose a integer vector of {2,0,3,1} is the input , here note the values
   range from 0 to 3. This represents a 4x4 chess board with Queen's placed
   at the following locations
      (0,2) , (1,0) , (2,3) , (3,1)
      (0,a[0]) , (1,a[1]) , (2,a[2]) , (3,a[3])
   Since no duplicates are allowed ,by definition
   there cannot be 2 queens in the same row or column.
   The function's job now reduces to checking for diagonals.

   How to do that in a single pass ?
   here comes the linear algebra to our help. Any line is of the
   form y = m*x + c where 'm' is the slope and 'c' a constant.
   now since these are queen's , the diagonals have a slope of 1 and -1.
   that means if a coordinate (j,a[j]) has to be cut by
   a queen placed at (i,a[i]) one of the following conditions must hold.

   ( (a[j] - a[i] ) / (j - i) ) == 1 or -1

   which is
   (a[j] - j ) = (a[i] - i) or (a[j] + j) = (a[i] + i)

   to do this in a single pass , as and when we encounter a coordinate
   , we check if it cuts any of the previous lines by looking up the
   sets diag1 and diag2. If so , return false else add the current difference
   and sum to diag1 and diag2 respectively.

        //    if not add else bail out returning false
        // b) see if (a[i] + i) is added in set
        //    if not add else bail out returning false
